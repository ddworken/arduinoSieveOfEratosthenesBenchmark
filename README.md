arduinoSieveOfEratosthenesBenchmark
===================================

Used to benchmark an arduino by timing the arduino as it calculates all of the prime numbers up to 1,000,000 via the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This works well for benchmarking Arduinos as it requires usage of large amounts of RAM along with a large amount of mathematical calculations.
