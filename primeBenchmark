			        	 * 		-it first checks if i (the multiple) times j (what we're multiplying it by) is less than or equal to maxNumber, if it is than it continues
			        	 * 		-it then crosses out that number by setting that location in the booleanIsItPrimeArray to false
			        	 * 		-once the second line loop finishes, then it goes to the above for loop and moves onto the next multiple, 3
			        	 * -if that multiple has already been set to false, (e.g. 4 would already be set to false because it is a multiple of 2), then it does not continue 
			        	 * 		-thus if it is already false then it will loop back and try the next multiple
			        	 * -it will then continue this behavior until it reaches maxNumber, at which point it has crossed out all of the non-primes
